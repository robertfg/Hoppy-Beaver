# Hoppy-Beaver
Capture the Sticks and Avoid the Pooper! (Khan Academy-Advanced JavaScript Course)

This is a side-scroller game developed as a project on Khan Academy.  My modifications were the following:
1.  Added left and right arrow movement.
2.  Added the pooper and poop objects and collision handling.

Instructions:
1.  Copy all files into one folder.
2.  Double-click "Hoppy Beaver.html" to begin.

Rules:
1.  Use the space bar to hop to capture the sticks.
2.  Use the right and left arrow keys to avoid the "pooper."
3.  Capture 38 of 40 sticks to win, but you can change this in the js file.
